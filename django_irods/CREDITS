Thanks go out to the #django channel and the django-users mailing list for all their consultative help.  This code is
the result of my necessities for the successful completion of several ongoing projects with the NSF and others,
including CI-BER and the National Weather Service's WxEM collaborative agreement with RENCI.

Thanks to all of you,

Jeff.
